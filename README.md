## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 📊 Classification Project - Iris and Seeds Datasets (2025)
Built and evaluated classification models on two datasets:

- Applied Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Rule-Based (JRip) to the Iris dataset; Decision Tree to the Seeds dataset.
- Evaluated models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Specificity, and ROC Curves.
- Assessed generalization performance using k-Fold Cross-Validation (k = 5, 10, 15, 20).
- Compared Decision Tree performance between the Iris and Seeds datasets.

### 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Seeds and Data Quality Datasets (2025)
Performed a detailed exploratory analysis on two datasets:

- Conducted data cleaning by identifying missing and invalid (negative) values.
- Generated descriptive statistics and five-number summaries.
- Visualized distributions through histograms and compared transformations.
- Analyzed attribute relationships and class differences post-cleaning.
