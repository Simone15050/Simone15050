# 👋 Hi, I'm Jordan Brown

🎓 I'm a Computer Science major at Fairleigh Dickinson University with a passion for data analysis, intelligent systems, and solving real-world problems through software. Whether it's building simulations or analyzing datasets, I enjoy the process of turning complex ideas into working solutions.

## 💻 Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, SQL, C++, C#, R  
**Tools & Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, VS Code  
**Game Engines:** Unity, Unreal Engine

## 🚀 Featured Project

### 🧠 Taxi Driver (AI Class Project – 2023)
A simulation of an autonomous taxi operating in a grid-based town:
- The town is represented using 0s (roads) and 1s (sidewalks)
- The taxi searches for customers (2's) on sidewalks
- Once a customer is picked up, they provide a destination (grid coordinates)
- The taxi navigates to the destination, calculates fare based on distance, and drops the customer off
- After a 300-minute shift (based on units moved), performance is evaluated by comparing expected vs actual earnings and time
